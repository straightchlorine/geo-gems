### README.md in progress

In order to use application you can either clone this repository and run

`npm start`

This will run a simple development build.

In order to actually use the application, it is recommended as per [React docummentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/), to take following steps:

`npm run build`
`npm install -g serve`
`serve -s build`

Thanks to that you will start your own web server along with the application.
